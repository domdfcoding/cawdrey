class bdict(UserDict):
	"""
	Returns a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument
	and a possibly empty set of keyword arguments.

	Each key:value pair is entered into the dictionary in both directions,
	so you can perform lookups with either the key or the value.

	If no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created.
	If a positional argument is given and it is a mapping object, a dictionary
	is created with the same key-value pairs as the mapping object.
	Otherwise, the positional argument must be an iterable object.
	Each item in the iterable must itself be an iterable with exactly two
	objects. The first object of each item becomes a key in the new
	dictionary, and the second object the corresponding value.

	If keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are
	added to the dictionary created from the positional argument.

	If an attempt is made to add a key or value that already exists in the
	dictionary a ValueError will be raised

	Keys or values of ``None``, ``True`` and ``False`` will be stored internally as
	``"_None"``, ``"_True"`` and ``"_False"`` respectively
